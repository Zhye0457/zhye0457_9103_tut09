# Quiz 8 – Design Research for Major Assignment

## Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration

**Inspiration Source:** *Dark Souls III – Opening Cinematic*

The cinematic style of *Dark Souls III* inspires my project with its desaturated color palette, dramatic lighting, and decayed fantasy environments. I want to incorporate the use of backlit fog, high-contrast lighting, and ruined architecture to build an epic medieval atmosphere. These techniques align perfectly with my assignment's theme of a knight venturing through a broken world.

## Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration

**Technique:** *Three.js Volumetric Lighting Shader*

To achieve the same moody and atmospheric lighting as Dark Souls, I found a volumetric light shader implemented in Three.js. It creates fog rays and depth effects that simulate light scattering through dusty air, enhancing the epic and ruined feeling in real-time 3D. This technique is useful for prototyping lighting before final rendering.
